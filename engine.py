    Tests the model over the classification task by computing classification accuracy and loss.
    It uses either the nodes in the test or in the validation set depending on the parameter is_validation.

    :param loss_fn: A PyTorch loss function to calculate loss on both datasets.
    :param ds: the full graph dataset
    :param is_validation: True is it should test over the validation set, False if the test is done over the test set
